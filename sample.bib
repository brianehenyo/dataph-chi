  abstract = "In developing open data policies, governments aim to stimulate and guide the publication of government data and to gain advantages from its use. Currently there is a multiplicity of open data policies at various levels of government, whereas very little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact. Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available, as open data is a recent phenomenon and is thus in an early stage of development. In order to help bring about a better understanding of the common and differentiating elements in the policies and to identify the factors affecting the variation in policies, this paper develops a framework for comparing open data policies. The framework includes the factors of environment and context, policy content, performance indicators and public values. Using this framework, seven Dutch governmental policies at different government levels are compared. The comparison shows both similarities and differences among open data policies, providing opportunities to learn from each other's policies. The findings suggest that current policies are rather inward looking, open data policies can be improved by collaborating with other organizations, focusing on the impact of the policy, stimulating the use of open data and looking at the need to create a culture in which publicizing data is incorporated in daily working processes. The findings could contribute to the development of new open data policies and the improvement of existing open data policies."

abstract = "This article presents a case study of the open data project in the Chicago area. The main purpose of the research is to explore empowering potential of an open data phenomenon at the local level as a platform useful for promotion of civic engagement projects and provide a framework for future research and hypothesis testing. Today the main challenge in realization of any e-government projects is a traditional top–down administrative mechanism of their realization itself practically without any input from members of the civil society. In this respect, the author of the article argues that the open data concept realized at the local level may provide a real platform for promotion of proactive civic engagement. By harnessing collective wisdom of the local communities, their knowledge and visions of the local challenges, governments could react and meet citizens' needs in a more productive and cost-efficient manner. Open data-driven projects that focused on visualization of environmental issues, mapping of utility management, evaluating of political lobbying, social benefits, closing digital divide, etc. are only some examples of such perspectives. These projects are perhaps harbingers of a new political reality where interactions among citizens at the local level will play a more important role than communication between civil society and government due to the empowering potential of the open data concept."

abstract = "The open government data (OGD) movement has rapidly expanded worldwide with high expectations for substantial benefits to society. However, recent research has identified considerable social and technical barriers that stand in the way of achieving these benefits. This paper uses sociotechnical systems theory and a review of open data research and practice guidelines to develop a preliminary ecosystem model for planning and designing OGD programs. Findings from two empirical case studies in New York and St. Petersburg, Russia produced an improved general model that addresses three questions: How can a given government's open data program stimulate and support an ecosystem of data producers, innovators, and users? In what ways and for whom do these the ecosystems produce benefits? Can an ecosystem approach help governments design effective open government data programs in diverse cultures and settings? The general model addresses policy and strategy, data publication and use, feedback and communication, benefit generation, and advocacy and interaction among stakeholders. We conclude that an ecosystem approach to planning and design can be widely used to assess existing conditions and to consider policies, strategies, and relationships that address realistic barriers and stimulate desired benefits."
